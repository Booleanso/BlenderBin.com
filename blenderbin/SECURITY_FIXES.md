# Critical Security Fixes - BlenderBin API Routes

## Overview
Fixed major security vulnerabilities where API routes were not properly verifying subscription status, allowing unauthorized access to premium features.

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Download Route (`/api/download/route.ts`)
**❌ BEFORE:** No subscription verification - anyone with a user ID could download BlenderBin
**✅ AFTER:** Proper subscription verification using `verifyFirebaseToken()` 

**Changes:**
- Added `Authorization` header requirement
- Added `verifyFirebaseToken()` call to check subscription status
- Returns 403 error for users without valid subscriptions (including trials)
- Redirects unauthorized users to `/pricing/blenderbin`

### 2. AI Server Route (`/api/ai-server/route.ts`)
**❌ BEFORE:** Fake authentication - code literally said "For simplicity in this demo, we're just checking for existence"
**✅ AFTER:** Real Firebase token verification with subscription checking

**Changes:**
- Replaced fake authentication with `verifyFirebaseToken()` call
- Added subscription verification for authenticated users
- Returns 403 error for authenticated users without subscriptions
- Maintains freemium access for non-authenticated users (20 queries/day)

### 3. Subscription Verification Logic (`shared.ts`)
**✅ ALREADY CORRECT:** The `verifyFirebaseToken()` function properly:
- Checks for developer status (bypass)
- Verifies subscription status in `customers/{userId}/subscriptions` collection
- Recognizes both `trialing` and `active` subscription statuses
- Matches BlenderBin price IDs
- Sets `has_subscription: true` for valid users

## New Endpoints

### `/api/subscription/verify`
Test endpoint to verify subscription verification is working correctly.

**Usage:**
```bash
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_FIREBASE_TOKEN" \
     http://localhost:3000/api/subscription/verify
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "hasAccess": true,
  "userId": "user123",
  "email": "user@example.com",
  "isDeveloper": false,
  "subscriptionStatus": "active",
  "message": "User has valid BlenderBin access"
}
```

## Security Flow

### For Trial Users:
1. User completes trial checkout → Stripe webhook creates subscription with `status: 'trialing'`
2. User requests download/AI features → `verifyFirebaseToken()` checks subscription
3. Function finds subscription with `status: 'trialing'` → grants access
4. User gets full premium access during trial period

### For Active Subscribers:
1. Trial converts to paid → Stripe webhook updates subscription to `status: 'active'`
2. User requests features → same verification process
3. Function finds `status: 'active'` → grants access

### For Free Users:
1. User requests premium features → verification returns `has_subscription: false`
2. API returns 403 error with redirect to pricing page
3. User can still use freemium AI features (20 queries/day) if available

## Testing

1. **Test with trial user:**
   - Complete trial signup
   - Try downloading BlenderBin → should work
   - Try AI features → should work

2. **Test with free user:**
   - Don't complete trial
   - Try downloading BlenderBin → should get 403 error
   - Try AI features (authenticated) → should get 403 error
   - Try AI features (non-authenticated) → should work with limits

3. **Test verification endpoint:**
   ```bash
   curl -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
        http://localhost:3000/api/subscription/verify
   ```

## Important Notes

- **Trial users get full access** - both `trialing` and `active` statuses grant access
- **Developer bypass** - users with `developer: true` get automatic access
- **Freemium still works** - non-authenticated users can still use AI with daily limits
- **Proper error handling** - invalid tokens return 401, no subscription returns 403

## Impact

**BEFORE:** Major security breach - anyone could access premium features
**AFTER:** Secure access control - only paying/trial users can access premium features

This fixes critical revenue protection issues and ensures the subscription system actually works as intended.
